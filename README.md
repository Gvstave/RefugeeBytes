- ⁠challenges faced
  As a team, we had a challenge of finding the footer backgroung color, but later managed to employ an item called, 'Color Selector' which then gave a perfect color-fit.

- We also had challenge of finding the exact images that were required, and after some many minutes later, we managed to find them and add them on the site.
